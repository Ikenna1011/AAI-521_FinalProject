# Automatic Emotion Recognition through Facial Expressions

The study of facial micro-expressions is a well-established field, but it is still relatively new from the computational perspective with many interesting problems
Advances in computer algorithms and video acquisition technology have rendered machine analysis of facial micro-expressions possible today
We present a proof of concept for micro-expressions spotting and recognition. Individual stages involved in the automation of these tasks are described in the presentation.
